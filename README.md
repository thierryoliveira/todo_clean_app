# ✨ todo_clean_solid ✨

🚀 A basic ToDo app, made to show how I use some development principles like SOLID, Clean Architecture and Clean Code. State management, service location and tests also are used to develop the better version of this code. 

## Chosen dependencies
🤖 [BLoC with Cubit](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/flutterbloccoreconcepts) for state management ([flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc))  
💉 **GetIt** for service location (dependency injection)  
🔥 Firebase as backend service, using the real time database and the auth service (**firebase_core**, **firebase_auth** and **cloud_firestore**)  
🧪 MockTail to make easy mock classes on tests  
🔀 DartZ for error handling with functional programming  


## ‼️ Considered subjects
In this project I shown my way to code following some important development subjects. The development always will be a cycle steps like develop-deliver-refactor, so mind about the difficult level to make changes on your code is really important. This is the point that a clean code, without dependency coupling and following best practices makes the workflow flow easier.
## Features already done
✅ Sign in and Sign up pages with firebase auth  
✅ Task list page, listing all your added tasks  
✅ "Add a new task" widget. A quick way to create a task     
✅ "Trash button", to delete a task that you no more want to see on your list     
## Next Steps
🕐 Tests for features already developed and for core classes   
🕐 Crashlytics service, logging when something went wrong, helping to track bug behaviors  
🕐 Internationalization - translate the app texts depending on the device locale
