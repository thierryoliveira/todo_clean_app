# ✨ todo_clean_solid ✨

🚀 A basic ToDo app, made to show how I use some development principles like SOLID, Clean Architecture and Clean Code. State management, service location and tests also are used to develop the better version of this code. 

## Chosen dependencies
🤖 [BLoC with Cubit](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/flutterbloccoreconcepts) for state management ([flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc))  
💉 **GetIt** for service location (dependency injection)  
🔥 Firebase as backend service, using the real time database and the auth service (**firebase_core** and **firebase_auth**)  
🧪 MockTail to make easy mock classes on tests

## Features already done
✅ Sign in and Sign up pages with firebase auth

## Next Steps
🕐 Tests for features already developed and for core classes  
🕐 Task list page, listing all your added tasks  
🕐 Add a task page, with all necessary textfields to describe your task as you want  
🕐 Push notifications to notify you when your task time is running out  
🕐 Crashlytics service, logging when something went wrong, helping to track bug behaviors
